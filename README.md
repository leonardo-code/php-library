# php-library
A light and fast php web template you can use to separate presentation and logic layer. 


#Faq:

::What is it? 

 A light MVC php system to decouple model and view. 
 
::Why? 

Other frameworks don't have tags in <ABCD> normal HTML standard, so you can work better using HTML editors or IDE (no mess). 
 Files are compiled, so the system runs fast. Files are not compiled again until you modify them, so it's very fast!
 I hate spaghetti architectures.

::Can I use/copy this code?

Yes: it's completely free and open. 


Enjoy it. I do.
